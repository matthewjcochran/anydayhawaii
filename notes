Hi Matthew!

Congratulations on your new Student Hosting Account :)

If you bought a domain name with another provider, you will have to update your DNS to the following:

Nameserver 1: ns1.c6566.sgvps.net
Nameserver 2: ns2.c6566.sgvps.net

If you bought your domain with us, we will take care of this for you ;)

Once your DNS is setup (can sometimes take a couple hours) you can login to your hosting account with the information below:

  -  Control Panel: http://anydayhawaii.com/cpanel
  -  FTP Address: anydayhawaii.com
  -  SFTP and SSH Port: 18765
  -  IP Address: 185.56.86.180
  -  Username: anydayha
  -  Password: 7M2wd28zJx

During the first 48 hours of service, if you have trouble accessing your site, please try these troubleshooting tips: http://webhostingforstudents.com/faq/#access

Thanks!
