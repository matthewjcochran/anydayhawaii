    <h3>Lyon's and Da Spot</h3>
    <h2>Nature and Natural Food</h2>
    <img class="photo" src = "img/lyons0.jpg" alt="E">

    <p>Lyon's Arboretum is a hidden gem. Located in near the Manoa Falls and Paradise Park, it's easy to miss.  Indeed, many locals have never been here.</p> 

   <img src = "img/icon/down.png" alt="icon" class="down">
   <img src = "img/icon/up.png" alt="icon" class="up" style="display: none;">

    <div class="body" style="display: none;"> 
        <p>We entered from the Manoa Falls parking lot. Driving down the long and ding road, we felt lost. Parking is free. We were here on Saturday and it wasn't crowded. Go to the gift shop, make the suggested $5 donation, and get a map. You can buy snacks, drinks, tee-shirts, soap, and other funky stuff too.</p>
        <p>The arboretum is surprisingly big. It would be easy to spend the entire day exploring all of the side trails. The main path can get uneven and rocky so hiking shoes are recommended. There are mosquitoes so bug spray is required.</p> 
        <p>Get ready to see unusual and pretty flowers. We saw red jewels under green leaves, pink ghost puffs, and wicked dinosaur beauties.</p>
        <img class="photo" src = "img/lyons1.jpg" alt="E">
        <p>After the arboretum, we got lunch Da Spot. The restaurant is cafeteria style and popular with hippies, surfers, and UH Manoa athletes. It serves delicious, healthy Mediterranean food for a good price. Also, there have smoothies. Parking is tricky but doable. Our bill was under $20 for two.</p>

    <h3>Ethiopian and Bar 35</h3>
    <h2>An Evening in Chinatown</h2>
    <img class="photo" src = "img/ethopian1.jpg" alt="Ethiopian Love Restaurant seating inside">

    <p>Chinatown is the artsy, cool, and shady part of town. You'll find some of the funkiest restaurants in the state next to karaoke dive bars.</p> 

   <img src = "img/icon/down.png" alt="icon" class="down">
   <img src = "img/icon/up.png" alt="icon" class="up" style="display: none;">

    <div class="body" style="display: none;"> 
        <p>If you're driving, you might get lucky and find street parking, which is free after 6:00. Mark's Garage is always an option at $8 for the night. Chinatown Municipal Parking is a cheap and convient option too. Note that the strategy is to park somewhere and walk. If you're not driving, a cab ride from Ala Moana Center to Chinatown runs about $10.</p>
        <p>On this trip to Chinatown, we decided to try the Ethiopian Love Restaurant and made reservations for 5:00. This probably wasn't necessary since it was empty when we arrived. When we left around 7:00, however, it was packed and there was a wait.</p> 
        <p>Inside the ambiance was warm and inviting. Outdoor seating was unavailable during our visit because actor Zac Efron and crew were preparing to film a movie in the courtyard. There was some last minute shuffling of tables and chairs by the staff. Despite this, they were helpful and easygoing thought a bit winded.</p>
        <img class="photo" src = "img/ethopian2.jpg" alt="Ethiopian Love Restaurant Lentil Sambusa">
        <p>The menu at The Ethiopian Love Restaurant includes beef, lamb, and chicken dishes. Nevertheless, the restaurant is a great option for vegans and vegetarians. For an appetizer, we ordered Lentil Sambussa.</p>
        <img class="photo" src = "img/ethopian3.jpg" alt="Ethiopian Love Veggie Sampler for Two">
        <p>For the main course, the waiter recommend the Ethiopian Love Veggie Sampler for Two. We added the Timatam Salad. There are no utensils. You eat by tearing off pieces of injera bread and scooping lentils, peas, cabbage, kale, potatoes, and other spiced items. Everything we tried was delicious. Note that the restaurant is BYOB with a $3 corkage fee per person so you'll need to bring your own beer or wine. Plan ahead or stop at a nearby corner store. Our bill was $55 before tip.</p>
        <img class="photo" src = "img/bar351.jpg" alt="Honolulu Chinatown Bar 35">
        <p>After dinner we walked to Bar 35. They have a huge beer selection. If you're hungry, they offer unique twists on typical bar foods such as pizza and fries. We watched The Symths, a The Smiths cover band, do a sound check. On any given night, you can expect to see a band, DJ, or a least a movie playing on the wall. We've heard of Match.com meet-ups happening here too. If there's room, check out the courtyard in back. A couple of beers each cost us $20 before tip.</p>

    <h3>Kapiolani Beach and Lulu's</h3>
    <h2>A Perfect Waikiki Sunset</h2>
    <img class="photo" src = "img/lulus4.jpg" alt="A view of Kapiolani beach from Lulu's in Waikiki">

    <p>Waikiki is the Vegas strip of Hawaii and more. Anyone that tells you this isn't the real Hawaii is wrong. It's a beautiful, interesting spectacle with something for everyone.</p> 

    <img src = "img/icon/down.png" alt="icon" class="down">
    <img src = "img/icon/up.png" alt="icon" class="up" style="display: none;">

    <div class="body" style="display: none;"> 
        <p>Grab a book or magazine and head to Queen Kapiolani beach.  Out on the pier, you'll see drone pilots and kids doing cannon balls.  If you're lucky, you'll get to dance with the Hare Krishnas.  It's a fun place to sit and people-watch.</p>
        <img class="photo" src = "img/lulus1.jpg" alt="Two beers at Lulu's in Waikiki">
        <p>Located across the street on the corner of Kalakaua and Kapahulu, Lulu's is just upstairs from Starbucks.  It is a casual restaurant with a good selection of craft beer and great pub food. You'll see bikers, tourists, and everything in between here. A big draw is the spectacular sunsets.</p>
        <img class="photo" src = "img/lulus3.jpg" alt="Some nachos and a Caesar salad in Waikiki">
        <p>We tried the nacos and Caesar Salad. Note the full of order of nachos is huge even for two people. If you're feeling like a carnivor, the Magnum P.I. Burger is gaurenteed to fill you.</p>

    <h3>The Republik</h3>
    <h2>Music and Comedy</h2>
    <img class="photo" src = "img/therepublik.jpg" alt="The stage before Bill Burr at the Republik in Honolulu">

    <p>This small venue is a great place to see up and coming bands and comics. Much more intimate than the Blaisdell.  Reasonable drink prices with good food.  Mints provided in the bathroom.</p>

    <img src = "img/icon/down.png" alt="icon" class="down">

    <h3>It's Raining, It's Pouring</h3>
    <h2>See a Movie!</h2>
    <img class="photo" src = "img/dole1.jpg" alt="Sunset view from the Dole Cannery">

    <p>If the weather is crappy head to the Dole Cannery and see a movie.  This is a picture from the parking lot.  The theaters at Dole Cannery are much better than Ward Consolidated.  Less crowded and comfortable seating.</p>

    <h2>Koko Head Hike</h2>

    <p>Over a thousand steps to the top.  It's steep, there's a bridge, and watch out for bees.  Good luck. Well worth it though for the views of eastern and southern Oahu.</p>
