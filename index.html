    <h3>Lyon and Da Spot</h3>
    <h2>Nature and Natural Food</h2>
    <img class="photo" src = "img/lyons1.jpg" alt="Red heart flower at Lyon's Arboretum">

    <p>Lyon Arboretum is a hidden gem overshadowed by Manoa Falls and Paradise Park. It's easy to miss. Indeed, many locals have never been here.</p> 

   <img src = "img/icon/down.png" alt="icon" class="down">
   <img src = "img/icon/up.png" alt="icon" class="up" style="display: none;">

    <div class="body" style="display: none;"> 
        <p>You enter through the Manoa Falls parking lot and drive down a long and winding road. You'll probably feel lost. Parking is free. We were here on Saturday and it wasn't crowded. Go to the visitor center, make the suggested $5 donation, and get a map. Buy snacks, drinks, tee-shirts, soap, and other funky stuff if you like.</p>
        <img class="photo" src = "img/lyons2.jpg" alt="Fern path at Lyon's Arboretum">
        <p>The arboretum is surprisingly big. It would be easy to spend the entire day exploring all of the side trails. The main path can get uneven and rocky so hiking shoes are recommended. There are mosquitoes so repellant is required.</p> 
        <img class="photo" src = "img/lyons3.jpg" alt="Flowers at Lyon's Arboretum">
        <p>We learned that there are a gazillion different varieties of palms, ferns, and tea leaf plants. You'll see trees and shrubs from around the world. On this trip, we focused on pretty and unusual flowers. We saw red jewels under green leaves, pink ghost puffs, and wicked dinosaur beauties.</p>
        <img class="photo" src = "img/daspot.jpg" alt="Da Spot in Honolulu">
        <p>After the arboretum, we got lunch at Da Spot. This cafeteria style restaurant seems popular with hippies, surfers, and athletes in the UH Manoa area. It serves delicious, healthy Mediterranean inspired food at a fair price. They have smoothies too. The street parking is tricky but doable. Our bill was under $20 for two.</p>

    <h3>Ethiopian and Bar 35</h3>
    <h2>An Evening in Chinatown</h2>
    <img class="photo" src = "img/ethopian1.jpg" alt="Ethiopian Love Restaurant seating inside">

    <p>Chinatown is the artsy, cool, and shady part of town. You'll find some of the funkiest restaurants in the state next to karaoke dive bars.</p> 

   <img src = "img/icon/down.png" alt="icon" class="down">
   <img src = "img/icon/up.png" alt="icon" class="up" style="display: none;">

    <div class="body" style="display: none;"> 
        <p>If you're driving, you might get lucky and find street parking, which is free after 6:00. Mark's Garage is always an option at $8 for the night. Chinatown Municipal Parking is a cheap and convenient option too. Note that the strategy is to park somewhere and walk. If you're not driving, a cab ride from Ala Moana Center to Chinatown runs about $10.</p>
        <p>On this trip to Chinatown, we decided to try the Ethiopian Love Restaurant and made reservations for 5:00. This probably wasn't necessary since it was empty when we arrived. When we left around 7:00, however, it was packed and there was a wait.</p> 
        <p>Inside the ambiance was warm and inviting. Outdoor seating was unavailable during our visit because actor Zac Efron and crew were preparing to film a movie in the courtyard. There was some last minute shuffling of tables and chairs by the staff. Despite this, they were helpful and easygoing thought a bit winded.</p>
        <img class="photo" src = "img/ethopian2.jpg" alt="Ethiopian Love Restaurant Lentil Sambusa">
        <p>The menu at The Ethiopian Love Restaurant includes beef, lamb, and chicken dishes. Nevertheless, the restaurant is a great option for vegans and vegetarians. For an appetizer, we ordered Lentil Sambussa.</p>
        <img class="photo" src = "img/ethopian3.jpg" alt="Ethiopian Love Veggie Sampler for Two">
        <p>For the main course, the waiter recommended the Ethiopian Love Veggie Sampler for Two. We added the Timatam Salad. There are no utensils. You eat by tearing off pieces of injera bread and scooping lentils, peas, cabbage, kale, potatoes, and other spiced items. Everything we tried was delicious. Note that the restaurant is BYOB with a $3 corkage fee per person so you'll need to bring your own beer or wine. Plan ahead or stop at a nearby corner store. Our bill was $55 before tip.</p>
        <img class="photo" src = "img/bar351.jpg" alt="Honolulu Chinatown Bar 35">
        <p>After dinner we walked to Bar 35. They have a huge beer selection. If you're hungry, they offer unique twists on typical bar foods such as pizza and fries. We watched The Symths, a The Smiths cover band, do a sound check. On any given night, you can expect to see a band, DJ, or a least a movie playing on the wall. We've heard of Match.com meet-ups happening here too. If there's room, check out the courtyard in back. A couple of beers each cost us $20 before tip.</p>

    <h3>Kapiolani Beach and Lulu's</h3>
    <h2>A Perfect Waikiki Sunset</h2>
    <img class="photo" src = "img/lulus4.jpg" alt="A view of Kapiolani beach from Lulu's in Waikiki">

    <p>Waikiki is the Vegas strip of Hawaii and more. Anyone that tells you this isn't the real Hawaii is wrong. It's a beautiful, interesting spectacle with something for everyone.</p> 

    <img src = "img/icon/down.png" alt="icon" class="down">
    <img src = "img/icon/up.png" alt="icon" class="up" style="display: none;">

    <div class="body" style="display: none;"> 
        <p>Grab a book or magazine and head to Queen Kapiolani beach.  Out on the pier, you'll see drone pilots and kids doing cannon balls.  If you're lucky, you'll get to dance with the Hare Krishnas.  It's a fun place to sit and people-watch.</p>
        <img class="photo" src = "img/lulus1.jpg" alt="Two beers at Lulu's in Waikiki">
        <p>Located across the street on the corner of Kalakaua and Kapahulu, Lulu's is just upstairs from Starbucks.  It is a casual restaurant with a good selection of craft beer and great pub food. You'll see bikers, tourists, and everything in between here. A big draw is the spectacular sunsets.</p>
        <img class="photo" src = "img/lulus3.jpg" alt="Some nachos and a Caesar salad in Waikiki">
        <p>We tried the nachos and Caesar Salad. Note the full of order of nachos is huge even for two people. If you're feeling like a carnivore, the Magnum P.I. Burger is guaranteed to fill you.</p>
